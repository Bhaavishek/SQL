TABLE : yelp_business
Columns :
business_id:  varchar

neighborhood: varchar
address: varchar
city: varchar
state: varchar
postal_code: varchar
latitude:float

SOLUTION :-

-- In Postgress Sql ,Use STRING_TO_ARRAY to split the categories columninto an array based on a delimiter.  
--Then use UNNEST to split the array into multiple rows.  
--The result will show the business_id and each individual category that business_id falls under.

WITH category_tbl AS (
    SELECT business_id, 
           review_count,
           UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(categories, ';')) AS individual_categories
    FROM yelp_business
    )

-- GROUP BY individual_categories
-- and SUM the review_counts to generate
-- the total number of reviews for each category
SELECT individual_categories,
       SUM(review_count) AS review_cnt
FROM category_tbl
GROUP BY individual_categories
ORDER BY review_cnt DESC;
